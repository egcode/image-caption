## Description

NodeJS is wrapped around Pytorch Neural Network. <br>

Convolutional Neural Network is pretrained Resnet50.
CNN-RNN encoder-decoder pair  was trained with [COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org/#home).

 Approximate process of traing is described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) <br>
